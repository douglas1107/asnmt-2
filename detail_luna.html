                <p>A little about me: Luna is a majestic Maine Coon with a fluffy grey coat and striking white markings. 
                    She was found as a stray and has since become a gentle and affectionate 
                    companion. Luna enjoys perching on windowsills, watching birds, and being the 
                    center of attention. She's a bit shy at first but warms up quickly, especially if you 
                    have treats! Luna would thrive in a calm environment where she can relax and be 
                    pampered like the queen she is
                    </p>
