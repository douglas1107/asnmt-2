                <p>A little about me: Meet Baxter, a lovable Beagle with a knack for sniffing out fun! Baxter was 
                    rescued from a shelter and has blossomed into a friendly and outgoing boy. He 
                    loves long walks and has a keen sense of smell. He's great with kids and other 
                    dogs, making him the perfect family pet. His favorite pastime is chasing squirrels 
                    in the park and curling up for naps. Baxter is looking for a loving home where he 
                    can share his endless affection and playful spirit.
